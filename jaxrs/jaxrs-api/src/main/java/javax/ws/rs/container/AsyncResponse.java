/**
 * An injectable JAX-RS asynchronous response that provides means for asynchronous server side
 * response processing.
 * <p>
 * A new instance of {@code AsyncResponse} may be injected into a
 * {@link javax.ws.rs.HttpMethod resource or sub-resource method} parameter using
 * the {@link Suspended &#64;Suspend} annotation.
 * </p>
 * Each asynchronous response instance is bound to the running request and can be used to
 * asynchronously provide the request processing result or otherwise manipulate the suspended
 * client connection. The available operations include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>updating suspended state data (time-out value, response ...)</li>
 * <li>resuming the suspended request processing</li>
 * <li>canceling the suspended request processing</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Following example demonstrates the use of the {@code AsyncResponse} for asynchronous
 * HTTP request processing:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Path("/messages/next")
 * public class MessagingResource {
 *     private static final BlockingQueue&lt;AsyncResponse&gt; suspended =
 *             new ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;AsyncResponse&gt;(5);
 *
 *     &#64;GET
 *     public void readMessage(&#64;Suspended AsyncResponse ar) throws InterruptedException {
 *         suspended.put(ar);
 *         return ar;
 *     }
 *
 *     &#64;POST
 *     public String postMessage(final String message) throws InterruptedException {
 *         final AsyncResponse ar = suspended.take();
 *         ar.resume(message); // resumes the processing of one GET request
 *         return "Message sent";
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * If the asynchronous response was suspended with a positive timeout value, and has
 * not been explicitly resumed before the timeout has expired, the processing
 * will be resumed once the specified timeout threshold is reached, provided a positive
 * timeout value was set on the response.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By default a timed-out asynchronous response is resumed with a {@link javax.ws.rs.WebApplicationException}
 * that has {@link javax.ws.rs.core.Response.Status#SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE HTTP 503 (Service unavailable)}
 * error response status code set. This default behavior may be overridden by
 * {@link AsyncResponse#setTimeoutHandler(TimeoutHandler) setting} a custom {@link TimeoutHandler time-out handler}.
 * </p>
